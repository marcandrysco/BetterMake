Introduction

BetterMake aims to provide a build environment similiar to projects like
Automake built entirely using portable POSIX shell scripts and without the
extensive complexity of most current build systems. In order to keep the base
project and resulting environment lean, most functionality is offloaded to
external scripts that may be selected or deselected with ease.
