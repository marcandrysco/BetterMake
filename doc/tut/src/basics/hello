Hello World!

Setup

Create a new directory to house the application. To start, create the build
environment using the command $bmake install$, which will create the
$configure$ and $Makefile.in$ files and create the $mktests$ directory. Like
other build systems, the $configure$ script is used to build the $Makefile$
and any other required files.

Additionally, you will want to run the command $bmake test add sanity cc ld$,
which will execute tests of checking the sanity of the build envionrment, and
detecting your compiler and linker. These will be covered in more detail
later.

With the build environment created, you can create a $sources$ files that
instructs the system how to build your project and which files to compile.
Below is the $sources$ file for our basic $Hello World!$ application.

%code%
Target
	Name	"hello"
	Source	"code.c"
EndTarget
%~code%

All that is left is writing the C code. The below code should be appropriate.

%code%
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello World!\n");

	return 0;
}
%~code%
